## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

RFC-0008 (embedded agent emitters), slices 1-3: the IR can now be consumed directly by an
embedding host process, without going through the MCP transport at all.

### Added

- **`@archstone/emitter-support`** (#27). New package: the shared, target-agnostic substrate
  every emitter needs — Registry indexing, semantic-type → JSON-Schema lowering, and the
  response-mapping executor — extracted out of `@archstone/runtime`. MCP-SDK-free, fs-free, so
  a future embedded consumer (`@archstone/agent`) never gains a static edge to either. Pure
  relocation: zero logic drift, zero behavior change to the existing stdio/response-mapping/
  verify test suites.
- **`archstone build <dir>`** (#27). New CLI verb: compiles a manifest straight to a versioned,
  contract-stripped `archstone.ir.json` artifact on disk, for embedding hosts that want the IR
  without spinning up a server.
- **`@archstone/runtime` `/http` subpath** (#27). New fs-free Streamable HTTP transport
  (`createHttpHandler`) — the one shared transport both `@archstone/agent`'s `mcpHandler` and
  `archstone serve --http` build on. Requires a bearer token at construction (throws
  synchronously before any request handling if absent — fail-closed, not per-request); no CORS.
- **`@archstone/agent`** (#28). New package: the embedded agent SDK.
  - `fromIR()` — fail-closed version check, builds a Registry from a compiled IR.
  - `tools(format)` — thin envelopes over `@archstone/emitter-support`'s lowering for
    `anthropic` / `openai` / `gemini` / `json-schema` dialects.
  - `execute()` — composes REST invocation → response mapping into a 4-state result
    (`ok` / `degraded` / `violation` / `error`); Workers-safe env handling, never falls back to
    `process.env`.
  - Root entry has zero `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` reachability, enforced by a boundary test —
    embedding `@archstone/agent` in a host process never pulls in the MCP SDK transitively.
- **`@archstone/agent/mcp`** (#29). New subpath: `mcpHandler()`, a mountable Streamable-HTTP MCP
  handler built on `@archstone/runtime`'s `/http` transport — for hosts that want to expose the
  IR as MCP tools without running `archstone serve`.
- **`archstone serve --http`** (#29). New CLI flag: serves MCP over Streamable HTTP instead of
  stdio. Requires a bearer token (`--token` or `ARCHSTONE_HTTP_TOKEN`); fails closed and never
  binds a port if neither is set — never starts, let alone 401s, without one configured.

### Changed

- `@archstone/runtime`'s response-mapping module (`src/mapping.ts`) now re-exports
  `applyResponseMapping` from `@archstone/emitter-support` instead of implementing it —
  non-breaking, existing imports from `@archstone/runtime`'s root entry are unaffected.

## [0.2.0]

### Added

- **Typed resource output.** `*.resource.yaml` definitions are now loaded and resolved by the
  compiler: a capability output field like `collection: Stay` (or any `ref`/resource-typed
  field) resolves against a named resource, and the MCP emitter lowers the resolved fields
  into a typed, described `outputSchema` on the tool. Agents now see a resource's real shape
  (e.g. `Stay.name` / `location` / `pricePerNight` / `rating`) instead of a bare
  `{type: object}`/`{type: array}`.
- **Response mapping.** A binding may declare a `response:` block that maps a live provider's
  HTTP response onto the resource its tool outputs (`collection` JSONPath + a resource-field →
  provider-path `map`). At invocation, the runtime applies the mapping and validates it against
  the resource's required fields:
  - all required fields present → **OK**, mapped data returned as `structuredContent`;
  - an optional field missing → **DEGRADED**, returned with that field omitted and a warning;
  - a required field missing → **VIOLATION**, fail-closed — `isError:true` with a human-readable
    `content` message plus a structured error in `_meta["dev.archstone/contract_violation"]`
    (`{error: "contract_violation", capability, missing}`) — never a raw pass-through of the
    provider's body. Agents branch on the structured field, not parsed prose.
- **`archstone verify`.** New CLI command. For every binding with a `contract:` block, it
  replays the recorded request in `fixtures/<capabilityId>.golden.json` against the **live**
  backend, runs the response through the same mapping a real tool call would use, fingerprints
  the response shape, and reports a per-binding health status (🟢 unchanged / 🟡 shape drifted
  or degraded / 🔴 a required field is missing or the request failed). Exits non-zero on any
  🔴, so it drops into CI as a contract-drift gate. It is the only command that makes a live
  network call outside a real tool invocation, and is on-demand only — never triggered by
  `apply` or `serve`.
- **`archstone verify --json`.** Optional flag for `archstone verify` that renders per-binding
  health status as structured, machine-readable JSON instead of human emoji lines, so CI
  pipelines, dashboards, and ops tooling can consume health data programmatically. Two disjoint
  output shapes: `{results: [{capabilityId, status, detail}]}` on success (empty array when no
  bindings declare a contract), or `{error: "manifest_invalid", issues, errors}` when the
  manifest fails to load or validate. Exit codes unchanged (0 no-red / 1 any-red / 2 invalid).
  Stdout contains only the JSON document with no extra banner or log lines mixed in.

### Changed

- A capability output that references an unresolved resource name is now a **compile error**
  (`unknown-resource`) instead of silently lowering to a generic `object`/`array`.

### Breaking

- Manifests using `collection:`/`ref:` output fields need a matching `*.resource.yaml` to
  compile. See [`docs/ONBOARDING.md`](docs/ONBOARDING.md) for how to author one.

## [0.1.0]

Initial MVP walking skeleton: CDL manifest → schema validation → semantic validation →
compile to IR → MCP tools served over stdio, demoed end-to-end against Claude Desktop.
