// `archstone init` — THIN (ADD-37 §6 step 7, D-5).
//
// This file owns exactly three things: argv, the terminal gate, and rendering the report.
// Every decision of substance lives elsewhere and is testable without a terminal:
//   - what a document says            → `@archstone/init`'s adapters
//   - what becomes a manifest         → `emit`, pure
//   - whether anything is written     → `@archstone/init/loop`, one of two terminal states
//   - whether a request is ever made  → the probe gate, two independent conditions
//
// The gate produces DATA — a Decision Record — and nothing else. That is what lets a hosted
// "point us at your spec" flow (§9's forward constraint) supply the identical structure from a
// web form and reuse the core verbatim, and it is why this file has no business logic to test.

 *   `no-more-input`   — `AbortError`. Ctrl+D at a TTY raises it from `_ttyWrite`

 *   `terminal-closed` — `ERR_USE_AFTER_CLOSE`. Strictly the NEXT question after readline has
 *                       already closed.
 *
 * NAMED CAREFULLY, because the obvious split is wrong. "Cancelled" would read as "the user
 * changed their mind", and the same `AbortError` covers both that and a stdin that simply ran
 * out — which is the more common one in practice. The two are indistinguishable at this point,
 * so the label and the message say only what is actually known: there is no more input.
 *
 * Detected by `name`/`code` rather than `instanceof`, because the classes Node throws are
 * internal and not exported; the name and the code are the documented parts.
 *
 * Returning `undefined` for everything else is deliberate. Swallowing a real bug as "the user
 * changed their mind" would be a worse silence than the stack trace this replaces.

 * The REAL terminal `Ask` — and the reason it has to exist.

 * type-checks against a `readline.Interface` — which structurally satisfies `Ask`, since
 * `question(text, anything?)` is assignable — resolves with `""` on an empty line, and drops the
 * default on the floor.
 *
 * That is exactly what shipped: `runGate` was handed the `Interface` itself, so EVERY default in
 * the gate was dead. `--company` and `--domain` did nothing interactively, the
 * `${COMPANY}_API_URL` suggestion never appeared, and a computed capability id had to be retyped
 * in full. The minimum-keystroke path product §11.1 calls "the design" did not exist.
 *
 * It stayed invisible because the tests drive a fake `Ask` that honours the fallback — so they
 * implement the INTERFACE, and the interface is not where the bug is. The call site passes the
 * fallback correctly; it is dropped at the boundary. Nothing that substitutes for the boundary
 * can see a bug in the boundary.
 *
 * Two things this does, and both are load-bearing:
 *   - SHOWS the default, the way `confirm` already shows `[Y/n]`. A default the user cannot see
 *     is not a default, it is a coincidence.
 *   - Treats an empty line as the default — the identical rule `confirm` applies at its own
