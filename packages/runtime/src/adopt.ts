// @archstone/runtime — Adoption planner (ADD-117 / ADR-0008).
//
// Turns a field ADD-114's drift NAMED into a field the manifest DECLARES. This module is the
// pure half: it decides what could be adopted and why each rejected candidate was rejected.
// It touches no disk, asks no human, and mutates nothing — the CLI owns all three (D-6), which
// is what lets every rule below be tested without a temp directory or a terminal.
//
// The rules exist because ADR-0008 draws a hard line: an undeclared field never reaches a
// model. Adoption is the ONLY way across that line, and it is deliberately a human act.
