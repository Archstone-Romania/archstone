// @archstone/init — a deliberately small, deterministic YAML writer.
//
// Why not a YAML library: the emitted files are REVIEW SURFACES, not data dumps. Their value
// is the comment on each `response.map` line naming the source field and an observed example
// (product §5's legibility requirement — the only mitigation that exists for a mapping that is
// structurally right and semantically wrong). Interleaving comments with keys, in a fixed
// order, byte-stable across runs, is the whole job here; a general serializer makes that
// harder rather than easier, and would add a dependency to a module whose purity is the point.
//
// Why that is safe: quoting is CONSERVATIVE (plain style only for strings that cannot be
// anything else; `JSON.stringify` otherwise, which is always a valid YAML double-quoted
// scalar), and nothing this writer produces is trusted — the loop parses every emitted file
// back through the real `@archstone/schema` loader before a single byte reaches the target
// directory. An escaping bug here is a refused run, never a corrupt manifest.
