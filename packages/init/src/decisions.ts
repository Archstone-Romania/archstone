/**
 * Parse an untrusted value into a Decision Record, or say exactly what is wrong with it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, stated plainly because the omission was embarrassing: the Decision
 * Record is the ONE input `init` used to trust completely. Every other input — a spec
 * document, a backend response, a resource name — is shape-checked, refused with a named
 * reason, or fails closed. The record was `JSON.parse(...) as DecisionRecord`, an unchecked
 * cast, and a missing `company` produced a raw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of
 * undefined` with a stack trace.
 *
 * It matters most on the path where it is worst: `--non-interactive` is CI, where a stack
 * trace is the least actionable possible output, and where a human is not standing by to
 * re-read the docs.
 *
 * PURE and in this package rather than in `cli`, for the same reason `emit` and `formatReport`
 * are: a hosted flow (§9) accepts the identical structure from a web form and must get the
 * identical guarantees, not a second, laxer implementation of them.
