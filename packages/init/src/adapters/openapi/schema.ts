// The OpenAPI adapter — schema → Draft node (ADD-37 Amendment 1 D-10, D-12's adapter half).
//
// THE ONE RULE THAT DECIDES WHAT IS IN HERE AND WHAT IS NOT: a construct is handled iff
// reducing it requires NO CHOICE. `allOf` qualifies — the merged shape is a total,
// order-independent function of its members — and that is why it moved in, not because the
// only oracle happened to need it. `oneOf` with two real members does not, in general,
// qualify: which shape is it? Nobody but a human can say, so it is refused. `discriminator`
// marks polymorphism explicitly, so where it appears the merged shape is stated not to be the
// whole story, and it is refused too.
//
// ONE `oneOf` FORM IS HANDLED, and it passes the same rule rather than bending it: the items of
// a list as `oneOf[success, error]`, where exactly one of two object branches declares exactly
// one property with a scalar `const` (ADD-12 §8.1, §8.4 item 1). There the document itself
// answers "which shape is this row?" — a row carrying that value is the error row, every other
// row is the success row — and the ADD ratified what that answer lowers to: `resource` +
// `onError.errorResource`, with the `const` as `onError.when`. Nothing is chosen here. Every
// other two-member `oneOf` is still refused, under a `oneof-*` code naming which part of that
// form it lacks, and the accepted form anywhere but a list's items is refused too
// (`oneof-outside-collection`) — it has no `onError` to land in.
//
// If the next argument for letting a construct in is "the oracle needs it", that is the wrong
// argument and should be refused on sight.
