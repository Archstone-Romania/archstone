// @archstone/init — capability inference from an existing API (#37 / ADD-37).
//
// A compiler needs a manifest, and a stranger's first manifest is the friction. `init` reads
// whatever a company already has (a spec, a recorded response), asks a human the questions no
// tool can answer for them — is this a capability? is it `read`? what is it called? — and
// writes a manifest the REAL compiler has already compiled.
//
// THIS ROOT EXPORT IS PURE. No `node:fs`, no HTTP, no terminal, no clock, nothing under
// `providers/`, and no MCP SDK. Two things follow, and both are the reason for the split:
//   - `@archstone/init/loop` owns the filesystem, and only it;
//   - a hosted "point us at your spec" flow can call this identical core with bytes it
//     obtained however it likes, with no second implementation of the inference (§9).
//
// THERE IS NO LLM HERE. Not in this increment, not behind a flag, not on any path. Everything
// this package emits is derived mechanically from a source, or supplied by a human, or not
// emitted at all — which is why the same input produces the same output on every run, and why
// a user can put `init` in CI and diff the result.
