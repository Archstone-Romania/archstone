// @archstone/init/loop — the closed loop (ADD-37 §6 step 3).
//
// THE PRODUCT IS THE LOOP, NOT THE GENERATOR. Generation alone loses to "paste your spec into
// an assistant and ask for CDL"; generation that the REAL compiler immediately compiles does
// not. So this module's whole job is to stand between the emitted bytes and the developer's
// directory, and to have exactly two terminal states (D-7):
//
//     a compiling manifest was written   |   nothing was written, and here is why
//
// There is no "mostly works, fix the errors yourself" mode. That is an invariant with a test,
// not a quality goal — a tool that writes files it cannot defend is the thing the integrating
// developer is most afraid of (product §2).
//
// WHY A TEMP DIRECTORY (O-8): `load()` is fs-only — there is no in-memory entry point — and
// this increment deliberately does NOT refactor it for one caller's convenience. The emitted
// file set is materialized to a temp dir, compiled there, and only COPIED FROM THERE on
// success, so the bytes that land in the target are byte-for-byte the bytes that compiled.
//
// This is the only module in the package that touches a filesystem. The root export
// (`@archstone/init`) is pure and stays that way; that split is what lets a hosted flow reuse
// the inference core verbatim (§9's forward constraint).
