// @archstone/init — the report (ADD-37 §6 step 7, product §11.2).
//
// PURE, and in this package rather than in `cli`, for the same reason `emit` is: a hosted
// "point us at your spec" flow needs the identical report and must not reimplement it.
//
// WHY THE REPORT IS A PRODUCT SURFACE AND NOT LOGGING. R-9 is the risk automation cannot
// close: a mapping that is structurally right and semantically wrong (`price` mapped to a
// per-night rate when the backend returns a total) compiles, verifies green, and misleads an
// agent in production. Nothing detects that. What can beat it is a two-column diff a developer
// who already knows their own API can skim in a minute — which is why the report goes to a
// COMMITTABLE FILE as well as to stdout: the file is the pull-request review surface, and a
// reviewer who was not at the terminal is the second pair of eyes.
