// @archstone/init — reason codes: the scope boundary, made visible (ADD-37 R-6, D-7).
//
// `init` has exactly ONE disposition for anything it cannot handle: skip it, name it with a
// code from this list, and emit nothing for it. That rule is what keeps this increment from
// growing without a floor, and this enum is where the floor is written down — so a
// contributor adding support for a new construct must either reuse a code here or argue for
// a new one, in the open, rather than quietly half-handling it.
//
// TWO axes, deliberately not merged:
//   - `ReasonCode` (this file) — the disposition of ONE candidate (or of the manifest as a
//     whole) during inference and emission. A skip is informational: the run still succeeds.
//   - `LoopFailureCode` (loop.ts) — why NOTHING was written. A refusal is terminal.
// Merging them would let "we skipped one operation" and "we wrote no files" share a
// vocabulary, which is precisely the confusion D-7's two-terminal-states rule exists to
// prevent.

/**
 * Every reason `init` can give for skipping or degrading something.
 *
 * `skipsOperation: true` ⇒ the candidate produces NO files at all (D-7). `false` ⇒ the
 * candidate is still emitted, but something the source expressed did not survive the trip and
 * the report says so. A code is never "sometimes" one and sometimes the other.
 *
 * Codes marked *(adapter)* are not raised by any code shipping today: they belong to source
 * adapters (ADD-37 §6 step 5), which is exactly why they are declared here and not there —
 * the boundary is a property of `init`, not of whichever adapter happens to exist.
